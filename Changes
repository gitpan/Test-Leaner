        + Add : You can fall back to use Test::More by setting the
                PERL_TEST_LEANER_USES_TEST_MORE environment variable.
        + Doc : Document the restrictions on the regexp argument of like() and
                unlike().
                Thanks SÃ©bastien Aperghis-Tramoni for spotting this.
        + Doc : Document that is_deeply() doesn't check for memory cycles.
        + Fix : The plan will now correctly be printed at the end when
                'no_plan' was specified and some tests were failing.
        + Fix : Only print an ending plan once when the process is forked.
        + Opt : is_deeply() was optimized for large datastructures.
        + Rem : Scalar::Util is no longer an hard dependency. It will be used
                if it is present, but a fallback implementation is bundled.
